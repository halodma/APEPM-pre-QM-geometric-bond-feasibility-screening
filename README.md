# APEPM-pre-QM-geometric-bond-feasibility-screening
This code implements the APEPM model found on chemrxiv, and is intended to ideally be used either as a pre-QM screening method to see if bonds are geometrically possible (not energetically)(if overlap radius = 0, then there can be no bond), or see if a bond is possible at all based on distance between electron radii of 2 atoms.

# Please Note:
This model and paper relies on AREECM notation, the code already comes with the digital AREECM dictionary, but for the "+1" rule seen here that applies to AREECM notation, for a better understanding of AREECM, the AREECM paper can be found here on chemrxiv: https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jq84z-v3
